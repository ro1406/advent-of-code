# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges. Advent of Code is an annual programming competition that takes place every December, featuring daily coding puzzles that progressively increase in difficulty.

## 🎯 About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). It's a series of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. The puzzles are released daily at midnight EST/UTC-5 during December, and each puzzle has two parts. Completing the first part unlocks the second part, and solving both parts earns you two stars.
